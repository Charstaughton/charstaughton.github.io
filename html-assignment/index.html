    <h2>About Me</h2>
    
        <p> 
            My name is Charlene Staughton and this is my 1<sup>st</sup> website. I am very excited to be in the <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> program. I look forward to developing new skills and challenging myself. I am a 
            very passionate and <em>goal-oriented</em> individual. When I am curious about something I try to teach myself more about whatever it is. After school, I want to do more traveling and make a photo journal of my travels.
            I would like to build a brand for myself but I would also be interested in working for a company like National Geographic. When I put my mind to it, there is no stopping me. 
        
        As Jim Carrey once said:<blockquote>Maybe other people will try to limit me but I don't limit myself.
            <cite>-Jim Carrey</cite></blockquote>
        
            I have some revelant experience in the field. I have dabbled in Adobe programs like Photoshop and have created magazines and posters. I've done some work in videography and produced a few movie trailers with friends. 
            I am currently learning how to perfect my skills in Adobe Illustrator which has been both challenging and a lot of fun. So far, I have recieved positive feedback on the work I have done. This makes me proud of myself 
            and motivated to create more. I enjoy starting new projects and thinking outside the box! I love to draw out my ideas with pencil and paper. This helps me collect all of my thoughts in one place and start my creative process.
