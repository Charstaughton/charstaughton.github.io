<h2>About Me</h2>

<article>
    
<body>
    <p1> My name is Charlene Staughton and this is my 1<sup>st</sup> website. I am very excited to be in the <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> program. I look forward to developing new skills and challenging myself. I am a
        very passionate and <em>goal-oriented</em> individual. When I am curious about something I try to teach myself more about whatever it is.

        When I put my mind to it, there is no stopping me. As Jim Carrey once said:<blockquote>Maybe other people will try to limit me but I don't limit myself.<cite>-Jim Carrey</cite></blockquote>
        I have dabbled in Adobe programs like Photoshop and have created a video magazines and posters. I have done some work in videography and produced a movie trailer with friends. I enjoy starting new projects and thinking outside the box!</p1></article>
